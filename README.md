### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to modify the styling of HTML elements based on user interactions. I utilized JavaScript to dynamically add and remove CSS classes, enabling the display of error messages when needed. These error messages would then be removed once the issue was resolved. Additionally, I undertook the challenge of using the project's local text sources, gaining valuable experience in their implementation. I encountered difficulties when implementing properties such as 'CSS gradient' and 'box shadow', as I experimented with various colors and techniques to achieve the desired design.

### Continued development

I aim to continually enhance my skills in manipulating the DOM using JavaScript and TypeScript. My goal is to work with intricate structures that can provide the optimal user experience.
